Cryptography is a very old science, whose goal is to secure communication, so that only its recipient could read it. There are a lot of methods to encrypt a message, from the simplest (like the 2000-year-old Cesarâ€™s code) to the most complex (like the World War 2 Enigma code) ; they all need both encryption and decryption keys (sometimes identical). In some cases (such as the Hill cipher), the key is represented by a matrix. You have to carry out such a matrix-based ciphering software, using the following process to encrypt :

1.    transcript the key into numbers using the ASCII table,
2.  convert the numbered key into a square matrix, the smallest possible size, and filling the lines first,
3.    transcript the clear message into numbers using the ASCII table,
4.   convert the numbered message into a matrix ; its number of columns should fit the key matrix size, and its number of lines should be as small as possible,
5.    multiply the 2 matrices, and write the answer linearly to get the encrypted message.
